Class 
class is a template for creating objects
constructor is called when a new object is created. It is a special method of initializing new objects.
new is used to create an instance of the class.
 Template literals are used for embedding expressions inside strings.

Array
Arrow functions use '=>' instead of the function keyword.
Arrow function 'counts greet' is a shorter syntax for writing functions using =>
Function Expression is the function assigned to a variable
parameter ' name' is the input passed to the function.
Functions call 'Daniel' executes the function with the variable "Daniel" as input.
The template literal '+' was used for string concatenation


 Array is a collection of elements
.map() transforms each element using a callback function.
 Arrow function 'num => num*num*num' is a short function that returns the cube of num.
Transformation 'map() creates a new array with the results of the cube operation.
 the cubing is a new array


Destructuring
object destructuring allows you to extract properties from an object into variables using '{}'
The const P1,P2 assigns object.p1 and p2.
This function helps in having easy access to objects and properties without repeated  dot notation. 


Modules
Modules allow code to be splinted into reusable File System.
Import allows to bring in those export into a another file.
Export allows to  share functions, variables or classes from one file.
The named Export can export multiple items, imported using curly braces.
 The code can be reused.


merged combines or merges the elements of the two objects name and age into array using the spread operator(...).
Makes shallow copy of arrays or objects.
 calls passes array elements as individual.


Ternary
The ternary operator is short hand conditional expression.
The conditions are evaluated and one of the two value are returned. 
Its often used to assign a value based on a condition.


Varuables
The variables store data for use in your program
'let' and 'const' were introduced to fix issues with var
The var is used to declare a variable
The 'const' is used to default, switching to 'let' only if there is need for re-assignment.
